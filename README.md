### 5.1 Requirements
There is no need for any special development environment to compile or
build this program from source code. However you will need other tools
to build the installers or other outputs.

If you have any supported Windows platform with the .net 6.0 runtime
installed, you can compile this program from source code.

The following development tools can also be used to modify and compile
the program:
- Visual Studio 2022
  Commerical product available from Microsoft and resellers.
  For more information see:
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/default.aspx

- Microsoft .net 6.0 SDK
  No-cost SDK for Windows and .NET development
  Downloadable from:
  https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0

In order to build the installer and other targets, you will need the following:

(will change, for now this don't work)
- Windows Installer XML Toolset (WiX) v3.0.5419.0
  The Windows Installer XML (WiX) is a toolset that builds Windows installation
  packages from XML source code.
  Downloadable from:
  http://wix.sourceforge.net/
  Installation Notes:
  - Default installation path of C:\Program Files\Windows Installer XML v3
    is the easiest, otherwise you may have to modify files.
  - Builds automatically from NAnt build script.
